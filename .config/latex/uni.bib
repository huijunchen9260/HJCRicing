The unique subgame perfect equilibrium prediction is that the side of trade with a monopoly will exploit the side of trade with competition to reap almost all of the gain. Our experimental evidence reveals that while responders do compete with each other to race to the bottom (consistent with the prediction), the monopolistic proposer settles down to offer a ‘fair’ share of the pie to those from whom he or she seeks majority support (contrary to the prediction).},

	abstract = {This study investigates the impact of women's education on fertility. For identification, we use the 1968 compulsory education law change in Taiwan, which generated a regression discontinuity design ({RDD}) setting. We use the whole population of women from the 1980 and 2010 Population Censuses. Results of our {RDD} estimation using the exact date of birth suggest that the law change was effective in boosting women's education, but it did not have any impact on fertility. This is in stark contrast to most previous studies using only the birth year as the running variable or using it to construct instruments, which find that women's education depresses fertility. This study demonstrates that using a discrete running variable in {RDD} may generate a false discontinuity for an otherwise continuous regression function. ({JEL} J13, C21, I2)},

Previous characterizations of appropriability are generalized to permit the possibility that own and rival R\&D are imperfect substitutes. We also describe how. equilibrium expenditures on process and product R\&D, as well as equilibrium market structure, depend on technological opportunities and spillovers. In contrast to previous work, diminished appropriability does not necessarily reduce R\&D expenditures. For example, under some conditions, an increase in the extent of process (product) spillovers will lead to an increase in product (process) R\&D. We estimate several variants of the model using manufacturing line of business data and data from a survey of R\&D executives.},

	abstract = {The impact of R\&D on growth through spillovers has been a major topic of eco- nomic research over the last thirty years. A central problem in the literature is that ﬁrm performance is affected by two countervailing “spillovers” : a positive effect from technology (knowledge) spillovers and a negative business stealing effects from prod- uct market rivals. We develop a general framework incorporating these two types of spillovers and implement this model using measures of a ﬁrm’s position in technology space and product market space. Using panel data on U.S. ﬁrms, we show that technol- ogy spillovers quantitatively dominate, so that the gross social returns to R\&D are at least twice as high as the private returns. We identify the causal effect of R\&D spillovers by using changes in federal and state tax incentives for R\&D. We also ﬁnd that smaller ﬁrms generate lower social returns to R\&D because they operate more in technologi- cal niches. Finally, we detail the desirable properties of an ideal spillover measure and how existing approaches, including our new Mahalanobis measure, compare to these criteria.},

Furthermore, output, consumer surplus and total welfare are higher in the Bertrand equilibrium than in the Cournot equilibrium if either R\&D spillovers are weak or products are sufﬁciently differentiated. If R\&D spillovers are strong and products are not too differentiated, then output, consumer surplus and total welfare are lower in the Bertrand case than in the Cournot case.

We establish conditions which, for perfect competition and monopoly, preclude the possibility that a given quality level is bought by more than one type of consumer (there is no "bunching"). Under these assumptions we show the existence of a unique price equilibrium in the duopoly case where firms must offer intervals of qualities. At all price equilibria in which both firms make a positive profit, discrimination of consumers is incomplete. When the firms choose their product lines they are influenced by two opposite effects. Discrimination among heterogenous buyers requires a broad quality range. On the contrary, price competition lowers profit margins on neighboring qualities sold by different firms, creating the Chamberlinan incentive for a firm to differentiate its products from those of its competitors. We show that the second effect dominates the first for intermediate qualities: at a Nash equilibrium of the quality game where each firm makes a positive profit, there is always a gap between the two product lines.},

	abstract = {We investigate the R\&D portfolio choices of multiproduct ﬁrms. When a ﬁrm increases cost-reducing R\&D invest- ment in a given product, its rivals will modify their entire R\&D portfolios by reducing R\&D investments in that particular product and increasing R\&D investments in other competing products. Our analysis demonstrates that R\&D portfolios will be more specialized when ﬁrms face greater competition, which will be the case if products become closer substitutes, a monopolist begins to face competition from a rival ﬁrm, or ﬁrms compete on price rather than quantity. R\&D cooperation allows ﬁrms to internalize the negative externalities of their R\&D investments in two ways: by reducing such investments across all products and by increasingly focusing their R\&D portfolios on different products. Firms may completely shut down a subset of their R\&D projects under R\&D cooperation if the products concerned are sufﬁciently close substitutes.},

A monopolist incurs profit diversion from its old good but may gain more than a rivalrous firm on the new good by coordinating the prices. In a Hotelling framework, we find simple conditions for the monopolist's gain to be larger. We also explain why the ranking of innovation incentives differs under vertical product differentiation.},

Product differentiation arises under all the scenarios considered, contrasting previous findings of symmetric quality choices under Cournot behaviour. However, to relax harsher market competition, firms differentiate more under Bertrand than under Cournot. A simple welfare measure also indicates that the economy is better off when firms compete on prices (with fixed costs of quality, not only consumer but also producer surplus is higher under price competition).},

The difficulty is not that there are too few theories of sex, the difficulty is that there are too many and none stand out. To distinguish between theories, we ask: Why are there no triparental species with offspring composed of the genetic material of three individuals? A successful theory should confer an advantage to biparental sex over asexual reproduction without conferring an even greater advantage to triparental sex. Of two leading theories (red queen and mutational), we show that only one is successful in this sense.},

	abstract = {Family business research appears to be caught in a “jungle” of competing theories in regards to familiness and performance. This study provides a further empirical examination into that relationship. We employ a family influence scale (the familiness-power, experience, and culture scale [F-{PEC}]) presented by Klein, Astrachan, and Smyrnios in an attempt to assess the relationship between familiness and performance in 831 family businesses. The resulting regression analysis adds to the current state of the literature by demonstrating significant and interesting results. Specifically, familiness showed associations with revenue, capital structure, growth, and perceived performance; however, the relationships were both positive and negative, thus casting doubt upon the F-{PEC} as a vehicle for untangling the jungle. We conclude with discussion and implications.},

It is found that increasing the number of firms tends to decrease cost reduction expenditure per firm, whereas increasing the degree of product substitutability, with or without free entry, increases it—provided that the average demand for product varieties does not shrink. Increasing market size increases cost reduction expenditure per firm and has ambiguous effects on the number of varieties offered, while decreasing the cost of entry increases the number of entrants and varieties but reduces cost reduction expenditure per variety. The results are extended to other measures of competitive pressure and to investment in product quality. The framework and results shed light on empirical strategies to assess the impact of competition on innovation.},

	title = {Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance},
	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1496716},
	abstract = {Provides a systematic presentation of the economic field of industrial organization, which is concerned with how productive activities are brought into harmony with the demand for goods and services through an organizing mechanism, such as a free market, and how variations and imperfections in the organizing mechanism affect the successful satisfying of an economy's wants. Of the three market mechanisms (tradition, central planning, and free markets), the field of industrial organization deals primarily with the market system approach. This book primarily emphasizes the manufacturing and mineral extraction sectors of industrialized economies, with less discussion of wholesale and retail distribution, services, transportation, and public utilities.         Beginning with a discussion of the welfare economics of competition and monopoly, the structure of industries in the U.S. and abroad and their determinants are described, including motives for mergers and their effects. Extended analysis of pricing, product policy, and technological innovation then follows. Antitrust, price fixing, related restraints, structural monopolies, regulation, and price discrimination are examined, as are the complex policies governing pricing relationships between vertically linked firms. The role of advertising in product differentiation and the roles of market structure and product variety are identified. Innovation, patents, and their relation to market structure are explored.  Overall, this analysis seeks to identify attributes or variables that influence economic performance and to build theories about the links between these attributes and end performance.  ({TNM})},
